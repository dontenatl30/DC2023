            <h4>Aaliyah's death</h4>
            <p>Tragically, Aaliyah was killed on August 25, 2001, when a small Cessna passenger 
                plane carrying the singer and her video crew crashed and burst into flames shortly 
                after takeoff from Abaco Island in the Bahamas, where they had just completed work on a video. 
                The plane was headed for Miami, Florida. Aaliyah and seven other people, including the pilot, 
                were believed to have died instantly, while a ninth passenger died later at a Bahamian hospital. 
                Aaliyah was 22 years old at the time of her death.</p>

        <p>Here is a quote from Pop in the 90's: Everything for Everyone article</p>

            <p>"Though, it goes against received wisdom to say so, the 90's deserve to go down as 
            the decade when the music industry opened its doors to all comers. Openmindedness, rather than any 
            single sound, was its great contribution: a lesson in diversity. And listeners responded, 
            buying their favorites even if they resented everything else.""
